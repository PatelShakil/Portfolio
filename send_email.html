        <h2>Concern on Uniform Civil Code (UCC)</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) raises concerns about its impact on religious 
            and cultural laws. Many communities, including Muslims, follow specific religious principles for social and familial 
            matters. The UCC may disrupt these traditions, leading to potential social disharmony.
